## 1. 📩 Intake & Context Capture

- Automatically ingest full error data: stack traces, logs, failed test output, or crash reports (e.g., from Sentry, Datadog).
- Preprocess and condense through an LLM to present only relevant context.  
  :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 2. 🧠 Root-Cause Analysis

- Use semantic/AST parsing + LLM (e.g., GPT‑4 or Claude) to explain “what happened and why.”
- Highlight faulty flow, var states, hints at bug classes (e.g., NPE, off-by-one).  
  :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 3. 🔍 Interactive Step-through Debugging

- Simulated breakpoints: inspect state, variables, control flow inline in IDE.
- Prompt-driven queries: _“Why is `user.id` null here?”_ and Cline inspects context and responds.

## 4. 🛠️ Automated Fix Generation

- Propose minimal, context-aware code patches sourced from known patterns.
- Include rationale, code diffs ready for preview and apply.  
  :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## 5. 🧪 Automated Test Update

- Generate or update unit/integration tests covering error and edge cases.
- Run pre/post-fix tests; enforce green status.  
  :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## 6. ⚙️ CI Integration & Validation

- In CI/CD, inject LLM-based “fix suggestion + test generation” stage before merge.
- Use tools like LogSage to analyze log failure patterns and auto-suggest fixes.

## 7. 🔒 Security & Performance Scan

- Post-fix, scan for regressions: SAST, SCA, secrets, injection checks, and performance regressions.  
  :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## 8. ✅ Human Approval Gate

- Present summary: root cause, patch, new tests, performance/security findings.
- Developer approves, refines, or rejects. Prevent auto-merge without sign-off.

## 9. 📚 Explain & Learn

- Cline provides “why this change fixes the bug,” reinforcing developer understanding.
- Developer feedback (approve/reject) is logged and used to fine-tune future suggestions.

## 10. 🔁 Continuous Feedback & Analytics

- Aggregate metrics: fix acceptance rate, detection speed, bug recurrence.
- Audit performance improvement and refine Cline over time.
